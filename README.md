# Rails - Next.js

## Motivation

This repository is a demo project demonstrating integration of Next.js and Ruby on Rails using a BFF (Backend For Frontend) architecture.

The aim is to enable the developer to easily transition between a Next.js front-end and a Ruby on Rails ERB front-end while maintaining the same URLs and user experience. The developer will be able to swap technologies on individual pages without any externally observable differences.

This capability should enable the developer to gradually transition a website built with ERB technology to one based on React, or vice versa. Instead of a "Big-bang" style release, the developer can release each page as it is ready, one by one.

## Wiki

See the wiki to set up the demo, how to convert an existing Ruby on Rails ERB website to React, and to learn more about this project.
