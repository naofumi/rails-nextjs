# About this App

I'm using this to test integration with Sodatech as a BFF.

1. Run this app on local with `yarn dev -p 3000` (port 3000)
2. Run Sodatech on Docker with `docker compose up`

Future stuff
1. Get NextJS working on a dev environment in Docker.
2. Authentication (Cookie relay idea?)


# Thoughts on setup

1. NextJS and Rails should both be on respective Docker containers. Otherwise, we have to potentially manage multiple versions of node on the same server.
2. NextJS should rewrite to Rails in cases where it does not have the path.
3. NextJS files should generally be on a dedicated sub-path. In most cases, we do not want NextJS paths over Rails paths.
4. The idea of gradually replacing Rails paths with NextJS paths by using the same URLs and overwriting is appealing at first. The problem is that NextJS paths do not differentiate based on request Method. Therefore, if NextJS has a "/courses" path (a file for this exists in the pages folder) which is intended for GET requests, then we cannot send a POST /courses request since the NextJS path will consume this. This means that we cannot send a POST /courses API request directly to Rails.

# With Docker

This examples shows how to use Docker with Next.js based on the [deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment#docker-image). Additionally, it contains instructions for deploying to Google Cloud Run. However, you can use any container-based deployment host.

## How to use

Execute [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) with [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/create/), or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) to bootstrap the example:

```bash
npx create-next-app --example with-docker nextjs-docker
# or
yarn create next-app --example with-docker nextjs-docker
# or
pnpm create next-app --example with-docker nextjs-docker
```

## Using Docker

1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) on your machine.
1. Build your container: `docker build -t nextjs-docker .`.
1. Run your container: `docker run -p 3000:3000 nextjs-docker`.

You can view your images created with `docker images`.

### In existing projects

To add support for Docker to an existing project, just copy the `Dockerfile` into the root of the project and add the following to the `next.config.js` file:

```js
// next.config.js
module.exports = {
  // ... rest of the configuration.
  output: 'standalone',
}
```

This will build the project as a standalone app inside the Docker image.

## Deploying to Google Cloud Run

1. Install the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) so you can use `gcloud` on the command line.
1. Run `gcloud auth login` to log in to your account.
1. [Create a new project](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/quickstarts/build-and-deploy) in Google Cloud Run (e.g. `nextjs-docker`). Ensure billing is turned on.
1. Build your container image using Cloud Build: `gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/PROJECT-ID/helloworld --project PROJECT-ID`. This will also enable Cloud Build for your project.
1. Deploy to Cloud Run: `gcloud run deploy --image gcr.io/PROJECT-ID/helloworld --project PROJECT-ID --platform managed`. Choose a region of your choice.

   - You will be prompted for the service name: press Enter to accept the default name, `helloworld`.
   - You will be prompted for [region](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/quickstarts/build-and-deploy#follow-cloud-run): select the region of your choice, for example `us-central1`.
   - You will be prompted to **allow unauthenticated invocations**: respond `y`.

Or click the button below, authorize the script, and select the project and region when prompted:

## Running Locally

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
